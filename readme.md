Flatscreen
==========

**A lighter, flatter way of embedding YouTube videos.**

Flatscreen only loads the YouTube `iframe` once a visitor has clicked on the thumbnail, speeding up the page's inital load time. Good for single or multiple videos on the same page. Complexity is taken care of, with only the height and/or width of the video needed.
